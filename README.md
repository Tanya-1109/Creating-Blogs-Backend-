## FastAPI

### I made this repo while learning FastAPI.

#### I made a backend for a blog storing web app containig authentication( using JWT token and OAuth). We can delete, store, update blogs for different users. Each User needs to make an account and needs to login. All the password is stored in an hashed way in the database(sqlalchemy) along eith blogs.
