## FastAPI

### I made this repo while learning FastAPI.

#### I made a backend for a blog storing web app containing authentication( using JWT token and OAuth). We can delete, store, update blogs for different users. Each User needs to make an account and needs to login. All the passwords is stored in a hashed way in the database(sqlalchemy) along with the blogs.

#### The backend is made using FastAPI and can be test using Swagger Docs which is an esssential function of FastAPI.
