## FastAPI

### I made this repo while learning FastAPI.

#### I made a backend for a blog storing web app containig authentication( using JWT token and OAuth). We can delete, store, update blogs for different users. Each User needs to make an account and needs to login. All the passwords is stored in a hashed way in the database(sqlalchemy) along with the blogs.
